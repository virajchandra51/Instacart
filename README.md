# Instacart
Clone to the Original Website : instacart.com 

1.  Install dependencies:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

        npm install react

3.  Run React:

        npm start

Tech Stack Used :

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Vanilla JavaScript
4. ViteJs
5. Firebase

Challenges Faced :

1. Cloning the website was not such of a copy paste scenario as I had pictured. SHA-Hash security for the original restriced me to pseudo classes and scripts.
2. Encountered some issues while hosting with Firebase, usually preferred a different hosting procedure, went with Firebase for the first time.
